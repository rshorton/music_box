# Sample audio

The audio in this folder can be used to test the functionality of the music box. Copy the folders contained in this folder to a fat32-formatted SD card.  The contents of the SD card should look like this:

<root directory>
  01

      001.mp3
      002.mp3
      ...
      005.mp3

  02  
  
      001.mp3
      002.mp3
      ...
      005.mp3

  03

      001.mp3
      002.mp3
      ...
      006.mp3


Optionally, if you provide clip 007.mp3 in folder 03, that clip will be played when power is applied to the music box.
